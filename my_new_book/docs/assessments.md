# Assessments

## Overview

This chapter outlines the comprehensive assessment framework for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. The assessment strategy emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application, with multiple evaluation methods designed to measure student progress across different learning outcomes. The assessments are structured to provide continuous feedback and ensure students develop both technical skills and conceptual knowledge.

The assessment approach includes formative assessments for ongoing learning, summative assessments for final evaluation, and peer assessments to encourage collaborative learning. Each assessment type is designed to align with specific learning objectives and provide meaningful feedback to students.

## Key Concepts
