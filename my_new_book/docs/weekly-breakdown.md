# Weekly Breakdown

## Overview

This chapter provides a structured 10-week breakdown for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. Each week builds upon previous concepts while introducing new technologies and methodologies. The schedule balances theoretical foundations with hands-on implementation, ensuring students gain both knowledge and practical experience.

The weekly structure is designed to accommodate different learning paces and provides flexibility for instructors to adjust based on student progress and available resources. Each week includes lectures, laboratory sessions, and project work that progressively build toward the capstone project.

## Key Concepts
