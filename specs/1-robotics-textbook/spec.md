## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Comprehensive Learning (Priority: P1)

A student can read through the textbook chapters and gain a foundational to intermediate understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, covering all topics listed in the course outline.

**Why this priority**: This is the core purpose of the textbook.

**Independent Test**: A student successfully completes a self-assessment covering all chapters and demonstrates comprehension of key concepts and their applications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reads the "Introduction" chapter, **When** they finish, **Then** they understand the scope and importance of Physical AI.
2. **Given** a student reads a module chapter (e.g., "Module 1: ROS2"), **When** they complete it, **Then** they can explain the fundamental concepts and practical applications of ROS2 in robotics.
3. **Given** a student reads the "Capstone Project" chapter, **When** they finish, **Then** they can articulate the requirements and potential approaches for the capstone project.

### User Story 2 - Navigation & Accessibility (Priority: P2)

A reader can easily navigate between chapters, search for specific topics, and access the content on various devices, ensuring a smooth learning experience.

**Why this priority**: Good navigation and accessibility are crucial for an effective textbook.

**Independent Test**: A user can successfully find information on "NVIDIA Isaac" using the textbook's search function and navigate to the relevant chapter.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the textbook's main page, **When** they click on "Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac" in the table of contents, **Then** they are directed to the beginning of that chapter.
2. **Given** a user uses the search bar for "VLA", **When** they hit enter, **Then** relevant results from "Module 4: VLA (Vision-Language-Action)" are displayed.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a chapter requires external resources (e.g., links to hardware specs, code repositories)? The textbook should provide clear links and instructions.
- How does the system handle very long chapters? Docusaurus's inherent structure (table of contents, headings) should facilitate readability.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The textbook MUST include all chapters specified in the course outline.
- **FR-002**: Each chapter MUST be written in Docusaurus Markdown format.
- **FR-003**: The content MUST be suitable for beginner-to-intermediate learners.
- **FR-004**: Each chapter MUST contain clear concepts, examples, and explanations.
- **FR-005**: The textbook MUST avoid unnecessary theoretical digressions.
- **FR-006**: The content MUST be technically accurate and align with robotics/AI fundamentals.
- **FR-007**: The textbook MUST only produce Markdown, without HTML or JSX.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Chapter**: A self-contained unit of learning content, following the Docusaurus Markdown format.
- **Module**: A collection of related chapters, as defined in the course outline (e.g., Module 1: ROS2).
- **Concept**: A fundamental idea or principle explained within the textbook.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of the chapters listed in the course outline are present in the textbook.
- **SC-002**: 90% of beginner-to-intermediate readers report improved understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics after completing relevant chapters.
- **SC-003**: All chapters successfully render as valid Docusaurus Markdown without errors.
- **SC-004**: A subject matter expert validates 100% of the technical content for accuracy and alignment with robotics/AI fundamentals.

## Assumptions

- The Docusaurus project structure and setup are already in place or will be handled as a separate task.
- The official course outline is the single source of truth for chapter requirements.
- Content authors will have access to necessary tools for Markdown editing and validation.
- Technical diagrams and illustrations will be provided separately or generated by content authors as image files.
